Performace Impact:

All builtins have a performance impact to give the user an idea of how fast all of the builtin and library
operations are. Scoring is calculated as follows:

 1 Point: Any command (/say, /data, etc...)
+1 Point: Any extra parts of an execute command (/execute if ... run ... is 2 points in total)
+1 Point: For any summon commands, since they require lots of allocations
